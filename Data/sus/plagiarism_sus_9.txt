Public perceptions of crime often associate it with violent activities and dangerous individuals, such as gangsters, terrorists, murderers, and sex offenders. This link between crime and violence is so entrenched that even crimes that do not directly involve physical aggression are often seen as inherently violent. It is undeniable that the idea of violence is intimately connected with notions of crime. As a result, a broad range of different powers has been given to criminal justice agents to deal with gangs,  including  preventive  measures  such  as  gang  injunctions  and  criminal  laws  aimed  at  facilitating  criminalisation  in  these  instances,  such as the infamous law of joint enterprise. However, this link is complex and problematic, and an uncritical understanding and deployment of it can contribute to perpetuating discrimination, marginalization, and miscarriages of justice in society. It is crucial to recognize that the violent character of certain activities is not self-evident, but rather, conditioned by their social, cultural, and historical context, and shaped by political pressures and power relations. For example, deaths caused by industrial activities and commercial decisions, which could easily be described as violent, are rarely deemed to be criminal. Conversely, individuals may be unfairly identified as dangerous offenders based on images that society recognizes and accepts as violent, even when that might not be the case.

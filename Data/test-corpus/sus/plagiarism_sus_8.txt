Despite only making up a small percentage of the world's population, the United States is responsible for a significant portion of global mass shootings, with an alarming rise in frequency and fatalities over the years. While discussions surrounding gun control and mental health approaches continue, the media's coverage of the events and the perpetrators may be a significant contributing factor. Another problem with gun control that may arise is the amount of firearms that arepresent within the nation. U.S. citizens currently own 40% of all the guns in the world, which is more than the next 25 top ranked gun ownership countries combined (Schaeffer, 2018). By focusing less on the offenders and more on the victims, future shooters may be discouraged from seeking fame and copycat crimes. Mass shootings not only cause multiple casualties and devastate families but also create fear and post-traumatic stress among the public. They are difficult to stop and often lead to hostage situations in large, crowded spaces. The effects of these shootings can be detrimental to both physical and mental health, leading to depression, PTSD, anxiety, fear, insomnia, anger, and long-term medical interventions. It is crucial to find ways to reduce these horrific events and their impact on the nation as a whole.

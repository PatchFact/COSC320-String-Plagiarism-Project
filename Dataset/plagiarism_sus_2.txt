Meditation is a practice that has been around for thousands of years and has been used for relaxation and stress reduction. It is a type of mind-body complementary medicine that produces a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress, resulting in enhanced physical and emotional well-being. The emotional and physical benefits of meditation include gaining a new perspective on stressful situations, building skills to manage stress, increasing self-awareness, reducing negative emotions, and improving sleep quality. Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine. Meditation can produce a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. Meditation can also be useful in managing symptoms of certain medical conditions such as anxiety, asthma, cancer, chronic pain, depression, heart disease, high blood pressure, irritable bowel syndrome, sleep problems, and tension headaches. There are different types of meditation, including guided meditation, mantra meditation, mindfulness meditation, qi gong, tai chi, transcendental meditation, and yoga. All of these types share the same goal of achieving inner peace. Different types of meditation may include different features such as focused attention, relaxed breathing, and a comfortable position. Meditation is not a replacement for traditional medical treatment, but it may be a useful addition to your other treatments.

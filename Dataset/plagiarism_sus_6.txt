This is a review of "Avatar: The Way of Water," the latest film in the "Avatar" franchise directed by James Cameron. The review notes that Cameron's belief in the power of cinema is evident in his ability to create a fully realized world on screen that transports viewers to a different place. The film's midsection, which focuses on the world-building of Pandora, is one of its greatest accomplishments. The protagonist of the film is the entire family and even the planet itself, while the antagonist is everything trying to destroy the natural world and the beings that are so connected to it. The review notes that Cameron's ear for dialogue hasn't improved, and some of the dialogue may earn unintentional laughter. The themes of environmentalism and colonization in the film could be considered shallow or problematic, but the film could be used as a starting point for conversations about those themes.

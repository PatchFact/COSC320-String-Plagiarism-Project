The war metaphor is being used frequently to describe the COVID-19 pandemic. Across the world, politicians, healthcare specialists, and much of the public at large are using language to frame the situation as if it were a war. War and the spread of disease have always been related â€“they were the combined agents of European genocides of Indigenous populations  throughout  the  Americas,  and  were  often  intertwined  with  colonialism. The United States has been particularly prone to this phenomenon. President Trump has referred to the pandemic as an "invisible enemy" that the U.S. is at war with, a term he has extended to the "Chinese virus." In an op-ed for The New York Times, David Katz calls on the U.S. and the world to "consider the surgical approach, while there is still time." However, this reliance on war language is neither accurate nor helpful. The relationship between war and infectious disease is not benign; they are often "deadly comrades." In fact, war itself could be viewed as a public health problem, given the significant numbers of chronic, infectious, and psychological health problems it generates. Therefore, it is important to find a better way to describe the pandemic, one that accurately captures the gravity of the situation without resorting to harmful metaphors.
